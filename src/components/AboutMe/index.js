      <h1>About Me.</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Kyle Condie, and I am a full stack web developer. I'm fairly
        new to the industry, but I have always had a personal passion for
        technology. I became a barber fresh out of highschool, and spent six
        successful years in that industry. However, I realized that not only was
        I capped out financially, but I was losing passion for it, and knew it
        wasn't going to get me where I wanted to be in life. As I mentioned,
        I've always been passionate about technology, and as I drifted from
        barbering, I knew I wanted to turn that passion into a career. I've
        completed the full stack web development boot camp through the
        University of Utah, and followed various paths of self education. I've
        also designed, and build many web applications varying from simple to
        complex front ends, back ends, and a hand full of full stack
        applications working both alone and in a group. I'm confident with
        HTML5, CSS3 (libraries included), JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js,
        JQuery, React, MySQL with Sequelize, and MongoDB with Mongoose. Feel
        free to check out my live projects in my portfolio, or all my work on my
        GitHub!
